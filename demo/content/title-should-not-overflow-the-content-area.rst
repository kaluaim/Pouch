Title should not overflow the content area
------------------------------------------

A few things to check for:

-  Non-breaking text in the title, content, and comments should have no
   adverse effects on layout or functionality.
-  Check the browser window / tab title.
-  If you are a plugin or widget developer, check that this text does
   not break anything.

The following CSS properties will help you support non-breaking text.

::

    -ms-word-wrap: break-word;
    word-wrap: break-word;
