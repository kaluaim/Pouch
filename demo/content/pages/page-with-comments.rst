| Repository-hosted Themes are required to support display of comments
  on static Pages as well as on single blog Posts.  This static Page has
  comments, and these comments should be displayed.
|  If the Theme includes a custom option to prevent static Pages from
  displaying comments, such option must be disabled (i.e. so that static
  Pages display comments) by default.
|  Also, verify that this Page does not display taxonomy information
  (e.g. categories or tags) or time-stamp information (Page publish
  date/time).
